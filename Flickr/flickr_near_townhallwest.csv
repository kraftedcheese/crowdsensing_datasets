Construction of the existing Melbourne Town Hall began in 1867 on the site of the first Town Hall at the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets. Architects Reed and Barnes won a competition for the design of the new Town Hall, and the firm was responsible for the portico which was added to the Swanston Street facade in 1887. An Administration Building was constructed to the north of the town hall in Swanston Street in 1908, and various alterations were made after a fire in 1925.

Reserved by the government in 1837, the site at the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets was issued as a Crown Grant to the Corporation of Melbourne in June 1849 as a site for a town hall. Designed by the City Surveyor, James Blackburn, the first Town Hall was subsequently completed c 1854. By the early 1860s it was already of insufficient size and the foundation stone of its successor was laid by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867.

The new Town Hall included a public hall, administrative offices, Lord Mayor's rooms and council chambers. Built in a French Renaissance style with slate mansard roofs, this freestone building consists of a rusticated bluestone plinth, a two storey section of giant order Corinthian columns and pilasters, an attic storey and a corner clock tower. The main Swanston Street facade is divided into five parts, with a central and two end pavilions. The central portico, added to this facade some twenty years after the initial construction to provide a grand entrance and balcony, is of a pedimented, temple form, with materials and details used to match the existing building.

From the mid-1880s to the late 1890s, the Town Hall was the venue for several important meetings on the question of Federation. These meetings marked significant advances in the progress of the Federation movement and were attended by many prominent individuals who were intimately involved in the issue. Among the critically important meetings held at the Town Hall were the January 1890 Australian Natives' Association Inter-Colonial Conference on Federation, the series of meetings in mid-1894 to found the Australasian Federation League of Victoria, the public meeting attended by three colonial premiers in January 1895, and the large public meeting of May 1898 that marked the climax of the pro-Federation campaign in Victoria for the first Federation referendum.

In 1888 the Melbourne Council bought the adjacent Police Court building from the government, therefore securing a site for future offices. In 1908 a building was erected on this site to accommodate the administrative staff, including the office of the Town Clerk, and also incorporated committee rooms and a new council chamber. The exterior was designed by J. J. and E. J. Clark, emulating much of the detail of the adjacent building, and the interior was completed by Grainger, Little and Barlow. The council chamber has been the meeting place of the City Council since 1910 and its design displays a post-Federation pride in Australian materials.

A fire in 1925 effected the first changes made to the Town Hall building. The main hall, together with the organ, was destroyed and as a result a new hall, designed by Stephenson and Meldrum, was built. By extending to the adjacent site in Collins Street, a larger hall was constructed and the existing Collins Street facade was extended. An additional, lower hall was also created, a new organ was built by British firm, Hill, Norman and Beard and decorative murals, featuring larger than life size figures, were installed in the main hall, to designs by Napier Waller, in conjunction with J. Oliver and Sons.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of architectural significance as a distinguished and important work by the prominent Melbourne architects Reed and Barnes, who designed a number of significant Melbourne buildings. It is also important as a prototype for numerous suburban town halls that were built in the late 1870s and 1880s. The Administration Building is of architectural significance for its functional and stylistic relationship to the Town Hall, which results in a coherent civic centre.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of historical significance as the civic centre of Melbourne since 1867 and for its association with the Federation movement in Victoria.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of scientific (technical) significance for its organ which is an intact, large and rare example of 1920s British organ-building craftsmanship. As the second largest organ built in the British tradition between World War I and 2, it is now the third largest organ in Australia, those at the Sydney Town Hall and the Sydney Opera House being larger. Few organs of this size are intact from this period, particularly of a secular/concert hall design. As part of the 1925 rebuilding, the intact case, grilles, pipework and console of the organ are architecturally integral to the main hall.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of aesthetic significance for the murals by Napier Waller, which provide an example of this important artist's work.",Australia;Victoria;Melbourne;Melbourne Open House 2010;2010;Open House;Architecture;10 Million Photos;Melbourne Open House;Public Toilet;Collins Street;Collins St;Ironwork;Melbourne Town Hall;Architectural;v1500i,,2010-07-24 12:01:43,0.041709639969822805,1

The Melbourne Town Hall is of scientific (technical) significance for its organ which is an intact, large and rare example of 1920s British organ-building craftsmanship. As the second largest organ built in the British tradition between World War I and 2, it is now the third largest organ in Australia, those at the Sydney Town Hall and the Sydney Opera House being larger. Few organs of this size are intact from this period, particularly of a secular/concert hall design. As part of the 1925 rebuilding, the intact case, grilles, pipework and console of the organ are architecturally integral to the main hall.

Construction of the existing Melbourne Town Hall began in 1867 on the site of the first Town Hall at the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets. Architects Reed and Barnes won a competition for the design of the new Town Hall, and the firm was responsible for the portico which was added to the Swanston Street facade in 1887. An Administration Building was constructed to the north of the town hall in Swanston Street in 1908, and various alterations were made after a fire in 1925.

Reserved by the government in 1837, the site at the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets was issued as a Crown Grant to the Corporation of Melbourne in June 1849 as a site for a town hall. Designed by the City Surveyor, James Blackburn, the first Town Hall was subsequently completed c 1854. By the early 1860s it was already of insufficient size and the foundation stone of its successor was laid by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867.

The new Town Hall included a public hall, administrative offices, Lord Mayor's rooms and council chambers. Built in a French Renaissance style with slate mansard roofs, this freestone building consists of a rusticated bluestone plinth, a two storey section of giant order Corinthian columns and pilasters, an attic storey and a corner clock tower. The main Swanston Street facade is divided into five parts, with a central and two end pavilions. The central portico, added to this facade some twenty years after the initial construction to provide a grand entrance and balcony, is of a pedimented, temple form, with materials and details used to match the existing building.

From the mid-1880s to the late 1890s, the Town Hall was the venue for several important meetings on the question of Federation. These meetings marked significant advances in the progress of the Federation movement and were attended by many prominent individuals who were intimately involved in the issue. Among the critically important meetings held at the Town Hall were the January 1890 Australian Natives' Association Inter-Colonial Conference on Federation, the series of meetings in mid-1894 to found the Australasian Federation League of Victoria, the public meeting attended by three colonial premiers in January 1895, and the large public meeting of May 1898 that marked the climax of the pro-Federation campaign in Victoria for the first Federation referendum.

In 1888 the Melbourne Council bought the adjacent Police Court building from the government, therefore securing a site for future offices. In 1908 a building was erected on this site to accommodate the administrative staff, including the office of the Town Clerk, and also incorporated committee rooms and a new council chamber. The exterior was designed by J. J. and E. J. Clark, emulating much of the detail of the adjacent building, and the interior was completed by Grainger, Little and Barlow. The council chamber has been the meeting place of the City Council since 1910 and its design displays a post-Federation pride in Australian materials.

A fire in 1925 effected the first changes made to the Town Hall building. The main hall, together with the organ, was destroyed and as a result a new hall, designed by Stephenson and Meldrum, was built. By extending to the adjacent site in Collins Street, a larger hall was constructed and the existing Collins Street facade was extended. An additional, lower hall was also created, a new organ was built by British firm, Hill, Norman and Beard and decorative murals, featuring larger than life size figures, were installed in the main hall, to designs by Napier Waller, in conjunction with J. Oliver and Sons.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of architectural significance as a distinguished and important work by the prominent Melbourne architects Reed and Barnes, who designed a number of significant Melbourne buildings. It is also important as a prototype for numerous suburban town halls that were built in the late 1870s and 1880s. The Administration Building is of architectural significance for its functional and stylistic relationship to the Town Hall, which results in a coherent civic centre.

There was once a famous book shop in Melbourne called Cole's Book Arcade. Cole's spanned from Bourke to Little Collins Streets, but owner E.W. Cole wanted it to span all the way to Collins Street. Unfortunately this was not possible because Howey Place stood in the way. So he bought all the shops down one side and paid to have the laneway covered (he was unable to convince the City of Melbourne Council to sell it to him) so he could have a &quot;continual&quot; arcade.

Hence Howey Place is covered in this ornate glass roof. 

Unfortunately Cole's Book Arcade wound-up in the 1930's and was demolished, but this is a lasting legacy to one of Melbourne's most successful early businesses.

So we gathered curious Victorians on Thursday, 18 November at the Melbourne Town Hall to ask the big questions of the main political players just nine days out from the state election. 

The night featured the Minister for the Environment, the Hon Gavin Jennings, the Shadow Minister for the Environment, the Hon Mary Wooldridge, and Greens MP, the Hon Greg Barber.

They were joined by a panel of environmental experts, including our very own CEO, Kelly Oï¿½Shanassy, Matt Ruchel from Victorian National Parks Association and comedian Claire Hooper from Good News Week who made the evening just a little fun. In addition the Q&amp;A was facilitated by a man who sure knows his stuff - Adam Morton, Chief Environment Reporter for The Age Newspaper.

They were joined by a panel of environmental experts, including our very own CEO, Kelly Oï¿½Shanassy, Matt Ruchel from Victorian National Parks Association and comedian Claire Hooper from Good News Week who made the evening just a little fun. In addition the Q&amp;A was facilitated by a man who sure knows his stuff - Adam Morton, Chief Environment Reporter for The Age Newspaper.

Stranger 131,"Hampus and his friend Laura were goofing off, posing for each other in front of some of the more colourful walls of Melbourne. They've both been in Australia for about five months and in Melbourne for five months of that. Hampus is deciding whether or not to start doing some work so that he can extend his visa and see a bit more of Australia than Melbourne.

A few years ago, Hampus and seven of his friends left Lagan, in Sweden to begin traveling. They decided that they would most probably never be in the same place again and have decided to all meet at Big Ben in fifteen years time. Just so he doesn't forget, Hampus has tattooed Big Ben and the date 2023-06-09
 on his right arm.

If anyone else is going to be around Big Ben at that time, look out for the giant bats.

I'm not particularly fond of this shot, I know it's not my best by any means. I took it well over a year ago with my old lens and it was reflections galore. I decided to upload it though as it's one of the coolest Porsche's I've seen in Melbourne thus far and the location's nice!

Tell me what you think, you may hate it or think it's a fair job and that I brought it back with editing :P Excuse the reflections, lol.

Architects Reed and Barnes won a competition for the design of the new Town Hall, and the firm was responsible for the portico which was added to the Swanston Street facade in 1887. An Administration Building was constructed to the north of the town hall in Swanston Street in 1908, and various alterations were made after a fire in 1925.

Reserved by the government in 1837, the site at the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets was issued as a Crown Grant to the Corporation of Melbourne in June 1849 as a site for a town hall. Designed by the City Surveyor, James Blackburn, the first Town Hall was subsequently completed c 1854. By the early 1860s it was already of insufficient size and the foundation stone of its successor was laid by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867.

The new Town Hall included a public hall, administrative offices, Lord Mayor's rooms and council chambers. Built in a French Renaissance style with slate mansard roofs, this freestone building consists of a rusticated bluestone plinth, a two storey section of giant order Corinthian columns and pilasters, an attic storey and a corner clock tower. The main Swanston Street facade is divided into five parts, with a central and two end pavilions. The central portico, added to this facade some twenty years after the initial construction to provide a grand entrance and balcony, is of a pedimented, temple form, with materials and details used to match the existing building.

From the mid-1880s to the late 1890s, the Town Hall was the venue for several important meetings on the question of Federation. These meetings marked significant advances in the progress of the Federation movement and were attended by many prominent individuals who were intimately involved in the issue. Among the critically important meetings held at the Town Hall were the January 1890 Australian Natives' Association Inter-Colonial Conference on Federation, the series of meetings in mid-1894 to found the Australasian Federation League of Victoria, the public meeting attended by three colonial premiers in January 1895, and the large public meeting of May 1898 that marked the climax of the pro-Federation campaign in Victoria for the first Federation referendum.

In 1888 the Melbourne Council bought the adjacent Police Court building from the government, therefore securing a site for future offices. In 1908 a building was erected on this site to accommodate the administrative staff, including the office of the Town Clerk, and also incorporated committee rooms and a new council chamber. The exterior was designed by J. J. and E. J. Clark, emulating much of the detail of the adjacent building, and the interior was completed by Grainger, Little and Barlow. The council chamber has been the meeting place of the City Council since 1910 and its design displays a post-Federation pride in Australian materials.

A fire in 1925 effected the first changes made to the Town Hall building. The main hall, together with the organ, was destroyed and as a result a new hall, designed by Stephenson and Meldrum, was built. By extending to the adjacent site in Collins Street, a larger hall was constructed and the existing Collins Street facade was extended. An additional, lower hall was also created, a new organ was built by British firm, Hill, Norman and Beard and decorative murals, featuring larger than life size figures, were installed in the main hall, to designs by Napier Waller, in conjunction with J. Oliver and Sons.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of architectural significance as a distinguished and important work by the prominent Melbourne architects Reed and Barnes, who designed a number of significant Melbourne buildings. It is also important as a prototype for numerous suburban town halls that were built in the late 1870s and 1880s. The Administration Building is of architectural significance for its functional and stylistic relationship to the Town Hall, which results in a coherent civic centre.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of historical significance as the civic centre of Melbourne since 1867 and for its association with the Federation movement in Victoria.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of scientific (technical) significance for its organ which is an intact, large and rare example of 1920s British organ-building craftsmanship. As the second largest organ built in the British tradition between World War I and 2, it is now the third largest organ in Australia, those at the Sydney Town Hall and the Sydney Opera House being larger. Few organs of this size are intact from this period, particularly of a secular/concert hall design. As part of the 1925 rebuilding, the intact case, grilles, pipework and console of the organ are architecturally integral to the main hall.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of aesthetic significance for the murals by Napier Waller, which provide an example of this important artist's work.",French Renaissance Style;Architecture;Architectural;Arquitectura;Stairs;Ironwork;Collins St;Collins Street;Town Hall;v500i;Stair,,2011-07-30 12:53:45,0.0838085894099455,1

Reserved by the government in 1837, the site at the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets was issued as a Crown Grant to the Corporation of Melbourne in June 1849 as a site for a town hall. Designed by the City Surveyor, James Blackburn, the first Town Hall was subsequently completed c 1854. By the early 1860s it was already of insufficient size and the foundation stone of its successor was laid by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867.

The new Town Hall included a public hall, administrative offices, Lord Mayor's rooms and council chambers. Built in a French Renaissance style with slate mansard roofs, this freestone building consists of a rusticated bluestone plinth, a two storey section of giant order Corinthian columns and pilasters, an attic storey and a corner clock tower. The main Swanston Street facade is divided into five parts, with a central and two end pavilions. The central portico, added to this facade some twenty years after the initial construction to provide a grand entrance and balcony, is of a pedimented, temple form, with materials and details used to match the existing building.

From the mid-1880s to the late 1890s, the Town Hall was the venue for several important meetings on the question of Federation. These meetings marked significant advances in the progress of the Federation movement and were attended by many prominent individuals who were intimately involved in the issue. Among the critically important meetings held at the Town Hall were the January 1890 Australian Natives' Association Inter-Colonial Conference on Federation, the series of meetings in mid-1894 to found the Australasian Federation League of Victoria, the public meeting attended by three colonial premiers in January 1895, and the large public meeting of May 1898 that marked the climax of the pro-Federation campaign in Victoria for the first Federation referendum.

In 1888 the Melbourne Council bought the adjacent Police Court building from the government, therefore securing a site for future offices. In 1908 a building was erected on this site to accommodate the administrative staff, including the office of the Town Clerk, and also incorporated committee rooms and a new council chamber. The exterior was designed by J. J. and E. J. Clark, emulating much of the detail of the adjacent building, and the interior was completed by Grainger, Little and Barlow. The council chamber has been the meeting place of the City Council since 1910 and its design displays a post-Federation pride in Australian materials.

A fire in 1925 effected the first changes made to the Town Hall building. The main hall, together with the organ, was destroyed and as a result a new hall, designed by Stephenson and Meldrum, was built. By extending to the adjacent site in Collins Street, a larger hall was constructed and the existing Collins Street facade was extended. An additional, lower hall was also created, a new organ was built by British firm, Hill, Norman and Beard and decorative murals, featuring larger than life size figures, were installed in the main hall, to designs by Napier Waller, in conjunction with J. Oliver and Sons.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of architectural significance as a distinguished and important work by the prominent Melbourne architects Reed and Barnes, who designed a number of significant Melbourne buildings. It is also important as a prototype for numerous suburban town halls that were built in the late 1870s and 1880s. The Administration Building is of architectural significance for its functional and stylistic relationship to the Town Hall, which results in a coherent civic centre.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of historical significance as the civic centre of Melbourne since 1867 and for its association with the Federation movement in Victoria.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of scientific (technical) significance for its organ which is an intact, large and rare example of 1920s British organ-building craftsmanship. As the second largest organ built in the British tradition between World War I and 2, it is now the third largest organ in Australia, those at the Sydney Town Hall and the Sydney Opera House being larger. Few organs of this size are intact from this period, particularly of a secular/concert hall design. As part of the 1925 rebuilding, the intact case, grilles, pipework and console of the organ are architecturally integral to the main hall.

The Melbourne Town Hall is of aesthetic significance for the murals by Napier Waller, which provide an example of this important artist's work.",,,2011-07-30 12:54:12,0.0838085894099455,1

City Square, corner of Collins &amp; Swanston Streets, Melbourne , Victoria 3000.

Designed by Charles Summers and costing ï¿½14,000, it was unveiled on 21 April 1865, four years after the explorers returned to the Dig Tree.

Originally on the corner of Collins and Russell Streets, the growth of traffic and the laying of tram tracks led to the removal of the monument in 1886. It was placed in a reserve in Spring Street, opposite Parliament House on the corners of Spring, Lonsdale and Nicholson Streets. It was moved to the corner of Swanston and Collins in City Square in 1979 and a fountain added.

The Manchester Unity Building is a Art Deco skyscraper in Melbourne, Australia, constructed in 1932.

History

The site, on the north-west corner of the intersection of Collins Street and Swanston Street, was purchased by the Manchester Unity of Odd Fellows in 1928, reportedly for the sum of ï¿½250,000. Architect Marcus Barlow designed the building, which was built by W E Cooper Pty Ltd, contracted for the price of ï¿½215,000. Construction commenced at midnight on 1 January 1932 with the demolition of the prior buildings on the site, and proceeded around the clock in eight-hour shifts.

For the first time in Australia a construction progress schedule was used to track and manage the construction of the building:

&quot;Upon [the schedule graph] is shown the progress of every section of the building as it must go forward... the exact time in which the excavation must be completed, when the escalators will be completed, and when the external painting will be finished... Progress payments to the builders are made upon the architects' certificate that the work is going forward to schedule.&quot;

Such was the speed of construction that in May the basement and ground floor arcade were structurally complete and ready to be fitted out, and by the end of July the roof had been laid, floors having been added at the rate of one a week on average. The shopping areas in the ground floor arcade, the basement and on the first floor were opened on 1 September.

A dinner for several hundred guests was held on 12 December 1932 in the building's basement to celebrate its opening, with Sir Stanley Argyle, the Premier of Victoria, giving a speech. On declaring the building open, Argyle pressed a button which turned on, for the first time, the lights illuminating the tower and spire.",Burke and Wills Statue;Swanston Street Melbourne Victoria Australia Manchester Unity Building.;Collins;Art;Deco;skyscraper;Robert O'Hara Burke;William John Wills;Canon;70;200;mm;f2.8;L;IS;II;USM,,2011-11-01 13:40:25,0.09509824226960238,1

The anarchist Chummy Fleming chaired the first May Day public meeting on the Yarra Bank in 1892. Anarchists continue to be part of the tradition of May Day in Melbourne.

In 2012 a small commemoration was held in front of Her Majesties Theatre where the MAC held it's first meeting in a first floor office on May 1, 1886. But the main public event was a gathering at the Melbourne 8 hour day monument. The gathering then held a vary anarchic march through the streets of Melbourne, going past the Police Remand Centre, the Law Courts where Max Brenner protestors are defending their right to protest in court, the Reserve Bank of Australia, several of the big 4 bank branches, and the Victorian parliament on Spring Street, before ending back at the 8 hour day monument, opposite Melbourne Trades Hall. 

The march was relatively small, perhaps 50 people, and soon attracted a 20 strong police escort. The best part was the music being pumped out of the sound system on the support vehicle. It made a long and potentially boring march into something a little bit more bearable.

Just like on <a href=""http://www.takver.com/history/mayday2001.htm"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">May  Day 2001</a> I had the feeling the ghost of <a href=""http://www.takver.com/history/chummy.htm"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Chummy Flemming</a> accompanied us on the march and benevolently smiled at all the young people keeping the spirit of anarchism alive, even though fashions and music have drastically changed.

Happy mothers day to all those selfless mothers who make all our lives so much more fulfilled.

This image was taken in Collins Street Melbourne on a wet wall on a wet day in early May 2012.
Every day I walked past that wall there was a different configuration of leaves but this one seemed representative of mothers day if not so many other occasions.

Staff were housed in dated office buildings which, although centrally located to the Town Hall, were nearing the end of their lifespan. Rather than relocate staff to alternative offices, Council embarked on an ambitious plan to construct a new office building, Council House 2 (CH2), that would meet its spatial requirements and lead the way in the development of an holistic green environment. CH2 has been designed to not only conserve energy and water, but improve the wellbeing of its occupants through the quality of the internal environment of the building. CH2 demonstrates a new approach to workplace design, creating a model for others to learn from and follow.&quot; Excerpt from <a href=""http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sustainability/ch2/aboutch2/Pages/AboutCH2.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sustainability/ch2/aboutch2/Page...</a>",Feet;CH2;Melbourne;Public,,2012-07-28 15:24:14,0.06772527101399799,1

The site, on the north-west corner of the intersection of Collins Street and Swanston Street, was purchased by the Manchester Unity of Odd Fellows in 1928, reportedly for the sum of ï¿½250,000. Architect Marcus Barlow designed the building, which was built by W E Cooper Pty Ltd, contracted for the price of ï¿½215,000. Construction commenced at midnight on 1 January 1932 with the demolition of the prior buildings on the site, and proceeded around the clock in eight-hour shifts.

For the first time in Australia a construction progress schedule was used to track and manage the construction of the building.

Such was the speed of construction that in May the basement and ground floor arcade were structurally complete and ready to be fitted out, and by the end of July the roof had been laid, floors having been added at the rate of one a week on average. The shopping areas in the ground floor arcade, the basement and on the first floor were opened on 1 September.

A dinner for several hundred guests was held on 12 December 1932 in the building's basement to celebrate itï¿½s opening, with Sir Stanley Argyle, the Premier of Victoria, giving a speech. On declaring the building open, Argyle pressed a button which turned on, for the first time, the lights illuminating the tower and spire.

The former Commonwealth Bank Of Australia building, 327-343 Collins St, Melbourne. A beautiful building and well worth a visit. However, be warned of the tripod police, I was busted!! The roof is adorned with 24 carat gold leaf.

It was the head office of the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd., from 1893 until 1982. The former C.B.A. Bank is a masterly amalgam of two diverse time periods and styles, the inner a nineteenth century masterwork of Lloyd Tayler and Alfred Dunn and the outer, a twentieth century tour de force by A.&amp; K. Henderson. The Banking Chamber, Entrance Vestibule, Archway and Gates remain from the building erected in 1891- 93.

The design was the result of a competition in which Tayler and Dunn jointly received first prize. Their five -storey office wing fronting to Collins Street was refaced in 1939 and extended to the present eight storey structure. The dramatic top-lit Banking Chamber is one of Melbourne's most impressive interiors, octagonal in plan and crowned by a dome composed of a series of intersecting arches. Derived from Italian Renaissance and Baroque sources (Guarino Guarini's S. Lorenzo Turin begun in 1666), the design is one of the last and perhaps most exuberant examples of that opulent period wiped away in the financial crash of 1893.
Most of the original furniture is in place, emphasising the fine proportions of the Chamber and the handsome materials of which it is constructed.

The street facade of 1939 is carried out in sandstone. It is a fine example of stripped modern classicism which at that time was so popular for banking premises and it alludes to many important international contemporaneous buildings. The introduction of vertical shafts within the central area of the facade contrasts with the richness of the earlier archway and gates located beneath. The timber panelled managerial suite of 1939 is part of the classification.

In 1990 the 1939 facade was replaced with a simplified version of the 1893 facade, the banking chamber was converted into a lobby for a new office tower above, repainted in its original colours, but retaining only short sections of the original counters.",Commonwealth Bank;Tayler and Dunn;Melbourne;Architect;Architecture;vorka;vorka70;vorkaimagery,,2013-04-05 10:37:00,0.08574917186108277,1

I smiled at her and continued to walk by when my wife turned to me and motioned that she would make an interesting portrait. So I doubled back  and made my way over to their table. Introducing myself I apologised for interrupting her meal which was a rather delicious bowl of ice cream. To my surprise she immediately agreed to a portrait and said that she was fine to let it melt.

Martina and her sister Sara have been in Australia on a working holiday trying to improve their English language skills. At home she works as a Dental assistant. They are from the Italian region of Abruzzo, which is located in the centre of the country and being that I am of Italian heritage myself really helped to make the encounter a more relaxed one. Our brief conversation was a mix of very poor Italian on my part and very good English on hers. 

Martina was a real natural in front the camera and I really enjoyed directing her to the get right shot.  As luck would have it, a gentle breeze came through the arcade right on time which provided the perfect movement in her beautiful, wavy hair. 
I think she has a rather glamorous ï¿½modelï¿½ look in this shot which I guess is what I was looking for.
I finished up by taking a photo of both girls together.

It was Neil that spotted her and turned to me to ask if I had seen the girl walk past wearing the Hijab with the gorgeous eyes and face. That was all I needed to head-off and chase her down. 
Skye and her friend were more than happy to participate in the project so we headed back to the ï¿½old rustic doorï¿½ that Neil had just used for the back ground. The light was deceptively glary which meant the bridge of Skyeï¿½s nose blew out just a touch. Oh well, live and learn. Next time I will be checking my screen for any blown highlights.

None the less Iï¿½m really pleased with how her portrait turned out and to honour Neilï¿½s generous find, I have posted the one frame that shows a wider view of the door way and Skye. Luckily you can still appreciate her lovely eyes.

Skye is originally from Melbourne but has lived in Singapore and Abu Dhabi for several years mainly due to her parents work commitments. She spoke with a rather thick American accent which was kind of weird, but she said that it was probably due to her years of international schooling. As you may have noticed Skye is of Islamic faith converting around 3 years ago. My first thought was that she had done so due to marrying a Muslim, but in fact she was drawn to it because she felt that it had similar ideals and beliefs to her own. At the moment Skye is studying at Deakin University and will be teaching language when she graduates.
Meeting Skye was a pleasant encounter and an interesting one.

In particular, I was interested in one of the ladies with long brown curly hair, large eyes and high cheekbones, which to me, is a pretty good combination of physical attributes that usually makes for great portraits. The question was does the personality match the beautiful exterior?

Well I need not have worried about that because as soon as I approached Ashleigh (and her friends) there was an immediate ï¿½yesï¿½ with a beaming smile.
While moving to the end of the arcade to find the better light, we chatted about what her and her friends were up to today. As it turns out, they had met up because they were all celebrating turning 21 roughly around the same time. The girls are from the town of Geelong and liked meeting in the city to catch up.

Ashleigh is studying a Bachelor of Education majoring in English and History and hopes to be teaching in high school. She also mentioned that she has a passion for special-needs kids and I could easily imagine how well her happy disposition would suit this line of work.

I really liked Ashï¿½s large wooden cross that she was wearing so I chose a slightly wider frame to include it.

Thanks for being part of the 100 Strangers Project and good luck with the teaching career.

With Stranger 100 done and dusted, I was much more relaxed for what was left of my trip to Melbourne.  Peter and Kathie had departed earlier in the morning, but Neil and I continued to wind our way through the lane ways that support Melbourne's thriving cafe (coffee?) culture.

We had just approached Block Place off Little Collins St. when I spied Lali.  She was sitting at C+B Cafe staring out towards Little Collins.  Seemingly oblivious to the world around her, there was something quite melancholy in her gaze.  Between her expression and the bright yellow sweater, I couldn't help but ask for a portrait.

She agreed to a shot quite easily, asking if I would also shoot her friend (who later disappeared).  There was a hint of surprise as Neil revealed the reflector and Lali seemed a bit self-conscious with the scale of the production (especially in such a small space), but her laid back attitude seemed to win out.  With the limited light in those lane ways, the reflector made a world of difference.

Afterwards, I showed her a couple of the shots and she commented that she looked &quot;horrible.&quot;  I beg to differ.

Thanks for participating in my project, Lali.  If you happen to see the photo, hopefully you will come around and like how the final image has turned out.  Happy to send you a copy if you're interested.

And with that, I've already started my second round!  Reflectors are my new favourite accessory!

<b>Constructive criticism is welcome and appreciated!</b>

People come to it, and some time back in their past they put aside the idea that everybody might be a dancer or an artist or a musician. Everybody has had some such a dream, but theyï¿½ve put it aside and gone on with their humdrum life. And then they see the street performer and see that somebody is managing to get away with it, with life, and managing to live between the cracks. I may never do it they say, but if somebodyï¿½s going to do it, it means my dream is still alive and maybe one day Iï¿½ll do it. Itï¿½s not too late. And thatï¿½s what a street performer is.ï¿½

The building is of concrete-encased steel construction, with the exterior cladding consisting of two hundred and fifty tons of terracotta faience tiles. Australian marbles are used extensively on interior walls throughout the building. Two escalators, the first in Melbourne, were installed by Austral Otis to provide access to the basement arcade and first floor from the ground floor arcade (though only one now survives). Three high-speed elevators were installed, capable of speeds of 600 feet per minute (3.0 m/s).
The building's roof reaches 132 feet (40 m), which was the height limit for buildings in Melbourne at the time of its construction, but the ornamental tower and spire extends a further 78 feet (24 m), as was permitted for non-habitable portions of buildings.

Melbourne's first Town Hall was completed in 1854. Begun in 1851, the work had ground to a halt with the beginning of the Victorian gold rush. 
The foundation stone of a new, grander Town Hall was laid on 29 Nov.1867 by the visiting Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, after the demolition of the first. 
The Town Hall was designed by the famous local architect Joseph Reed. Reed also designed the State Library of Victoria, the Royal Exhibition Building, and Melbourne Trades Hall. The current Town Hall officially opened on 9 Aug.1870 with a lavish ball. 
The foundation stone of the additional front portico was laid in 1887, and the administrative annex building foundation was laid on 27 Aug.1908. 
In 1925, a fire destroyed a large part of the town hall, including the main auditorium and pipe organ. It was rebuilt and enlarged. 
Incidentally, the magnificent concert organ in the Main Auditorium comprises 147 ranks and 9,568 pipes. The organ was originally built by Hill, Norman &amp; Beard of England in 1929, and was recently rebuilt and enlarged by Schantz Organ Company of America.",,,2013-11-21 17:00:47,0.051944298198010434,1

It is my first image done in this style and it's raw. It's not about the quality as such, but its an image that's been in my head and bringing into reality.
A 1920's New South Wales Criminal Photograph of &quot;William Stanley Moore&quot;, gave me the inspiration of it.
I am learning with 6D on how much I can do without a flash and natural light. The scene is natural light, but I am &quot;light painted&quot; upon with a white LED torch.
Image is 1 shot of 8 seconds.
The Cigar is lit and was hoping for more smoke.

I was in town today working on another project, which involved photographing Melbourne land marks with a long exposure to try and remove both the pedestrian and vehicular traffic from the scene.

Whilst I was waiting for one of my exposures (sixteen minutes) Michael approached me and enquired if I was doing street photography, and offered to pose, if indeed I was.

Not wanting to disappoint, I accepted his kind offer. Michael first adopted a formal pose with his shirt on, he then said &quot;I know, I'll take my top of and give you another pose&quot; (this image).

During our chat Michael revealed that he had only a few days previously been released from a mental health institution, and insisted on showing me his release papers.

He went on to tell me about his troubles with the Police, and also about his family. He also explained that he had avoided getting tattooed on his hands or face in case he needed to conceal them under a shirt, in the event that he ever got an office job.

Michael was more than keen that I put the images on the internet, and in fact almost insisted that I should put them in as many places as I could.

This is the forth in my 100 strangers project. Find out more about the project and see pictures taken by other photographers at the <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/groups/100strangers/"">100 Strangers Flickr Group page</a>  ",Melbourne;Portrait;Stranger,,2015-04-23 10:32:18,0.09482489229297944,1

After what felt like a productive day, I stowed my gear and started heading back to South Bank to pick up my luggage before going to the airport.  Opting to meander through the network of laneways instead of taking the more direct route gave me one last opportunity to look for strangers, but mostly to appreciate the vibrant atmosphere.

Without any expectations of taking another photo, I stumbled across Carmen and her husband, immediately thankful that I had chosen to go via the laneways.  Almost without thinking, I made my approach before they could disappear into the Royal Arcade, catching them halfway through the doors.

I explained what I was doing and the project, to which Carmen nodded, smiled, took my cards and then started to turn away.  Shocked that I was about to lose my opportunity, I held up my camera and asked again for her portrait.  At this point, her husband (thankfully) intervened and explained.

Unabashed by the reflector and resulting crowd, Carmen readily struck a pose in the middle of Block Place.  I was so concerned with being able to focus on her eyes through the veil, that I missed an opportunity to practice giving direction in Spanish.

It turns out that Carmen is from Bolivia and has been in Melbourne for a couple years.  According to her husband, she always dresses elegantly and has many, many hats.  Carmen's husband is a philosophy professor in Melbourne and they divide their time between living in Australia and Europe.

Gracias por su participaciï¿½n en mi proyecto de fotografï¿½a.  Si le gusta la foto, puedo mandarla a usted.  Mucho gusto!

I really struggled with the best way to crop this shot, given the tilt of her head and the awesomeness of her hat.  I also regret not having an alternate showing her whole ensemble.  Better luck next time, I suppose.

<b>Constructive criticism is welcome and appreciated!</b>

Bronze Dog.,"Larry La Trobe is the name given to a popular, cast bronze statue of a dog situated on the northern end of Melbourneï¿½s City Square (corner of Collins Street and Swanston Street). Along with the Burke and Wills monument, the statue is one of only two free standing art works in the City Square precinct. The statue now located in the square is the second statue of 'Larry', the original having been stolen.

Melbourne artist Pamela Irving created the statue as a result of a commission from the Melbourne City Council in 1992 and it was the first sculpture for Melbourneï¿½s Open Air Sculpture Museum. Based on her own dog, Lucy, the statue is not representative of any particular breed but was crafted to generate a sense of Australian larrikinism in the viewer. Irving named the statue after her uncle Larry and the surname 'La Trobe' was appended to represent the relationship with Melbourne and the state of Victoria. Charles La Trobe was the first Lieutenant-Governor of the state of Victoria.

As a magnificent structure, as a monument to human endeavour and as a hub of personal interaction, it has a special place in the history of Melbourne and the hearts of its citizens as well as the city's economy.

Constructed in 1932 on the site of Stewart Dawson's corner (plus the adjoining site), it was the new headquarters of the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), a non-profit friendly society with a strong sense of tradition and the noble motto 'Friendship, Love and Truth'. The architect, Marcus Barlow, had drawn his inspiration from the 1927 Chicago Tribune Building in the United States.

At that time the tallest building in Melbourne and built in the modern commercial Gothic style, the Manchester Unity Building was described by the Melbourne Age as a 'Wonder Building', with 'every modern convenience for tenants and their clients'. It was far ahead of its time, in terms of both aesthetic splendour and technological sophistication.

Built at a total cost of almost ï¿½600,000 for land and buildings, it was of fireproof concrete-and-steel construction and faced with 400 tons of mother-of-pearl coloured glazed terracotta (or faience) tiles. Large plate-glass windows on the first floor and ornamental bay windows on the second floor gave distinction to the base of the building, as did balconies on the third floor. More than 10,000 panes of glass made up some 900 windows on the upper floors, with levels 2 to 5 being double glazed.

At ground and mezzanine levels there were 23 shops and 7 kiosks, and the basement contained a 'beautifully decorated and furnished' tearoom and cafï¿½. A sub-basement housed secure vaults in which tenants could store documents, as well as large store rooms.

Throughout the ground-floor arcade, bold designs sand-blasted on a series of black-marble tablets and friezes illustrated aspects of Australian life, the services of the MU Order, virtues and other themes. They were complimented at mezzanine level by plaster relief work, 'as attractive as any art gallery'.&quot;

It was then that I noticed a young couple, both with cameras in hand, shooting from a bench on the side walk onto the street. I mistakenly thought she was trying to take a candid of me and so I playfully stopped to pull a face, but she was actually trying to get a photo of the street vendor selling flowersï¿½oops!

One thing led to another and I stopped to speak to Kealy and her friend. We chatted about what they were shooting and what we were doing which created the perfect segway to ask for a photo.

Kealy sheepishly said yes and we quickly shot a few frames with the stone wall as the background.
No reflector again but the light was reasonably good so Iï¿½m pleased with the wind swept result.

Kealy and her friend ( I think his name was Aidan) are both amateur photographers, but Kealyï¿½s real passion is for dance and I could see her face light up as she spoke about it becoming her career.
I really hope she achieves her goal.

Thanks Kealy for contributing to the Human Family Project.

This is portrait #18 in my Human Family project.

Westpac is the only one of Australia's big four banks to not publicly reject funding the Adani Carmichael coal mine. 

Climate activists launched a campaign to #stopAdani, focussing on Westpac Bank in Melbourne on 20th February 2017, and simultaneously in other cities around Australia

After the Paris climate conference in 2015 Westpac with other banks  committed to the global consensus that we need to limit global warming to below 2 degrees. Since December 2015 Westpac has continued to fund fossil fuels - handing over a whopping $900 million to coal and gas projects.

---------------------------------------

Trust Tony Stark to find himself in the company of a mysterious, Shakespearian &quot;Dark Lady&quot;!!

This piccy was taken against the side panels flanking the escalator down from the ground floor of the eastern entrance of the Manchester Unity Arcade. 

The 12 story Manchester Unity Arcade Building occupies the north western corner of the block where Swanston Walk and Collins Street intersects. It's a magnificent neo-Gothic structure, with many features that were cutting edge when it was built in 1932. It was constructed as the Australian lodge headquarters of one of the many 'Friendly Societies', in this case, the fraternal Manchester Unity Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF). 

I'd guess that the '18th Century'-ish costume and wig that the silhouette metalworked lass is sporting has something to do with the history of the Order, which stretches back to that era and beyond, or it could be intended to be entirely decorative with no deeper meaning at all, apart from to welcome Ladies &amp; Gents! (The latter having their own panels.)

It serves the entire metropolitan rail network. Backing onto the city reach of the Yarra River in the heart of the city, the complex covers two whole city blocks and extends from Swanston Street to Queen Street. The main station building, completed in 1909, is a cultural icon of Melbourne, with its prominent dome, arched entrance, tower and clocksï¿½one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Melburnian saying &quot;I'll meet you under the clocks&quot; refers to the row of clocks above the main entrance, which indicate the time-tabled time of departure for trains on each line; another saying, &quot;I'll meet you on the steps&quot;, refers to the wide staircase underneath these clocks. Flinders Street Station is responsible for two of Melbourne's busiest pedestrian crossings  /  Melbourne is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in Australia.  Its name refers to an urban agglomeration of  comprising a metropolitan area with 31 municipalities, and is also the common name for its city center. The city occupies much of the coastline of Port Phillip bay and spreads into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon ranges, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley.  It has a population of approximately 5 million, or a fifth of Australiaï¿½s population.  The city was founded in 1835, in what was the British colony of New South Wales, by free settlers from the colony of Van Diemenï¿½s Land. It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837 and named in honor of the British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. It was declared a city by Queen Victoria in 1847, after which it became the capital of the new colony of Victoria in 1851. In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush, the city entered the &quot;Marvelous Melbourne&quot; boom period, transforming into one of the most important cities in the British Empire and one of the largest and wealthiest in the world. After the federation of Australia in 1901, it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927. Today, it is a leading financial center in the Asia-Pacific region.  The city is home to many of the best-known cultural institutions in the nation, such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. It is also the birthplace of Australian impressionism, Australian rules football, the Australian film and television industries and Australian contemporary dance. More recently, it has been recognized as a UNESCO City of Literature and a global center for street art, live music and theatre. It is the host city of annual international events such as the Australian Grand Prix, the Australian Open and the Melbourne Cup, and has also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games.

It worked!  

Whilst waiting for my friend I decided to partake, and tried a new cocktail called &quot;Lisa's Leisure&quot;.  It consists of blackberry liquor, French champagne and cherries.  It was delicious.

The pink Gerberas (also known as &quot;happy flowers&quot;) were a gift for my friend, who is as bright as they are, and provided me with much happiness tonight when I needed it most.

Cheers!  Happy Monday to all my Flickr friends and followers!
